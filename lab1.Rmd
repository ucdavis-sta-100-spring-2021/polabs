### Hi! - Chi Po Choi
Hello everyone! My name is Po. I did bachelor+master in mathematics a while ago in Hong Kong, with some exposure in geometry (with applications in medical imagining, if have to make it related to bio-ish...) before shifting gears to do statistics here in Davis, working on something related to the Big Bang. I am also trying to get into data science things in Bay area. I am excited to meet you all!
