# Panda Village

![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/kungfupanda/images/6/63/Panda-village2.jpg)

1. Po visits the Panda Village. He captures **10 pandas** and marks their butts with paint.

2. A week later he returns to the village and captures **15 pandas**. **Five of these 15 pandas** have paint on their butts, indicating that they are recaptured pandas.

3. Can you guess/estimate the **total numbers of pandas** in the Panda Village?

   Poll: 
   
   - 20
   
   - 30
   
   - 40

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height = 6, fig.width = 10}
possibleN <- c(20, 30, 40)
panda_col <- hcl.colors(length(possibleN), palette = "TealGrn")
barplot(t(sapply(possibleN, function(N) dhyper(0:10, 10, N-10, 15))),
        beside=TRUE,
        main = paste0("Recapture probability of 10 marked pandas when population N = 20, 30, 40"),
        ylab = "Probability",
        xlab = "number of recaptured marked pandas out of 15 pandas",
        col=panda_col,
        names=0:10)
legend("topleft", legend = paste0("N=", possibleN), fill=panda_col) 
```
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height = 7, fig.width = 10}
possibleN <- 20:40
panda_col <- hcl.colors(length(possibleN), palette = "TealGrn")
barplot(t(sapply(possibleN, function(N) dhyper(4:6, 10, N-10, 15))),
        beside=TRUE,
        main = paste0("Recapture probability of 10 marked pandas when population N = 20, 21, ..., 40"),
        ylab = "Probability",
        xlab = "number of recaptured marked pandas out of 15 pandas",
        col=panda_col,
        bty='L',
        names=4:6)
legend("topright", legend = paste0("N=", possibleN), fill=panda_col) 
```

```{r fig.height = 8, fig.width = 8}
hyperLik <- function(N,M,n,m){dhyper(m,M,N-M,n)}
possibleN <- 20:40
likelihoods <- hyperLik(possibleN, 10, 15, 5)
plot(possibleN,likelihoods,
     type="l", 
     ylab="Likelihood",
     xlab="N",
     main = "Likelihood of N")
```

# Lab Assignment 3 (Lab projects?)

1. Go though `LabAssignment3.pdf` [LabAssignment3.pdf](LabAssignment3.pdf)

2. Download and open `LabAssignment3.Rmd` [LabAssignment3.Rmd](LabAssignment3.Rmd) in RStudio and run codes inside. Things should be exactly same as `LabAssignment3.pdf`.

3. Download, open `LabAssignment3_otg.Rmd` [LabAssignment3_jp.Rmd](LabAssignment3_jp.Rmd) and save as a new Rmd file for your own Lab Assignment submission. Knit this Rmd file to see if you can make a html, pdf or words. If you couldn't, just use RStudio Cloud or the Binder RStudio [![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](http://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ucdavis-sta-100-spring-2021/polabs/main?urlpath=rstudio) set by Po.

4. Run/add/edit/delete the codes in your own copy of `LabAssignment3_jp.Rmd` and add/edit/delete some writings. Knit to see how the .pdf looks like. Tidy up the codes and writings. Knit and submit!

### Help/Documentation

Read the R Documentation of the functions you learn today. Enter the following codes, one by one, and read the corresponding documentation/help in the **Help** tab.
```{r eval=FALSE}
?dhyper
```
```{r eval=FALSE}
?plot
```
```{r eval=FALSE}
?which.max
```
```{r eval=FALSE}
?read.table
```
```{r eval=FALSE}
?c
```
```{r eval=FALSE}
?head
```
```{r eval=FALSE}
?mean
```
```{r eval=FALSE}
?sd
```
```{r eval=FALSE}
?summary
```
```{r eval=FALSE}
?hist
```
```{r eval=FALSE}
?table
```
```{r eval=FALSE}
?mosaicplot
```
```{r}
?boxplot
```
```{r}
?aggregate
```
How Po knows all those built-in functions in R?

- Way 1: Google it

- Way 2: Read R Help/Documentation

# R tutorials that help you survive in Panda Village

- Interactive R course lessons **swirl** https://swirlstats.com/students.html

  Install **swirl** with the following commands.
  ```{r eval=FALSE}
  # If you haven't installed the swirl package yet
  install.packages("swirl")
  library(swirl)
  install_course_github("swirldev", "R_Programming_E")
  ```

  After **swirl** is installed (you only need to do it once), you can start/resume the R tutorial with the commands:
  ```{r eval=FALSE}
  library(swirl)
  swirl()
  ```
  Schedule some time to go though all the lessons by yourself! Almost all of the R codes you need to know are here in those lessons.
